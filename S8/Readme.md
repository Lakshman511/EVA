# Session 8

Added Resnet 18 code from the suggested github repo.

Replaced the final FC layer with 1x1 after GAP as we were instructed not to use FC in our course.

Obtained 85.87% accuracy at 8th epoch. I trained the model for 15 epochs and the final accuracy of it is 90.96

The updated models module is [here](https://github.com/sridevibonthu/EVA/blob/master/S8/eva4models.py). remaining modules of my library are unchanged.
